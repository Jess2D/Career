Hi Charlotte, 

My name is Jessica and I am a Software Engineer. I have been developing websites and applications for around 3 years. Most of my experiences lie in front end development and quality assurance.  I have worked with HTML, CSS, PHP, C#, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB. 

I have a work visa without time restrictions. My visa is until December 2021. The start date of my visa was 19 September 2019 and will finish on 04 December 2021. At the same time,  I will be applying for residence several months before that visa expires. 

When I saw the job opening, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to offer you both my development skills and tester skills. I've included my resume so you can learn more about my educational background and all of my work experience. Moreover, I would be happy to create a sample C# web application demo project to show my skills.
